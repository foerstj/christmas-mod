# christmas-mod
A Christmas mod for Dungeon Siege.

This mod adds Christmas trees in Fallraen and Glacern (and around the Glacern elevator). Also it replaces some of the DS music tracks with Christmas music.

This mod is designed to work together with Wintermod. If you use both mods, Christmas trees will also appear at the Farmhouse, in Stonebridge, and at Castle Ehb among other places; as well as corresponding places on the Utraean Peninsula multiplayer map.

Please don't sue me, this is just a private hobby project for an all-but-dead game <3
