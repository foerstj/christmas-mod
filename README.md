# Christmas Mod
A Christmas mod for Dungeon Siege.

This mod adds Christmas trees in some places. Also it replaces some of the DS music tracks with Christmas music. Oh yeah and Mountain Man is Santa.

Christmas trees are added in Fallraen and Glacern (and around the Glacern elevator), as well as Arhok and Illicor. It works by overriding the template of the lamp posts (and floating wizard statues).\
Music is mostly instrumental. Vocals are in Swedish.

This mod is designed to work together with Wintermod. If you use both mods, Christmas trees will also appear at the Farmhouse, in Stonebridge, and at Castle Ehb among other places; as well as corresponding places on the Utraean Peninsula multiplayer map.

## Compatibility

Should be fairly compatible but wasn't tested.

Please don't sue me, this is just a private hobby project for an all-but-dead game <3
